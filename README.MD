# Readme
This is simply a collection of tutorials written by me or rewrites of others' work to make my life easier since GitHub is accessible anywhere (and it has codeblocks!). If you've stumbled across this place by accident, please enjoy. I try to keep things updated if they change or I find a better way to do it.
