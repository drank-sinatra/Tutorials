# Make Linux Stay in Root Mode
Instead of having to constantly type in `sudo` every time you need to make an admin change, you can use one of these commands to act as root.

**SAFE:** Switch to using root mode, but still act as your user account:
`sudo -s`

**PARTY MODE:** Switch to full root mode and act as the user root:
`sudo -s -H`
